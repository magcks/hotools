## Contents
* args.h: A advanced and simple to use argument parser. It has support for short options (-x), long options (--xxyy) and a variable amount non-optional options. Short options can be grouped together (-a -b = -ab) without futher effort.
* progress.h: A progress bar, which runs in a different thread to not slow down the main program.
